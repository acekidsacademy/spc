Unfortunately I haven't found a good, robust way of handling database
migrations yet.  Gluino DAL has built-in migrations, but they don't
work always.  This is what is used when running "spc migrate".

The most recent git commit will modify the structure
of the datasource table to add a label column.  This was needed to
be able to properly support the "spc update" command.  To manually
fix this on older databases, use:

> alter table datasource add column label char(512);

at the sqlite3 command.  You may also have to run to turn on fake migrations by
editing src/migrate.py to have the parameter turn on as follows below.,

    self.db = DAL(uri, migrate=migrate, fake_migrate_all=True, folder=config.dbdir)

If you don't do this you may get an error the next time you run "spc migrate" or "spc update":
