Unfortunately I haven't found a good, robust way of handling database
migrations yet.  Gluino DAL has built-in migrations, but they don't
work always.  This is what is used when running "spc migration".

The most recent git commit will modify the structure
of the datasource table to add a label column.  This was needed to
be able to properly support the "spc update" command.  To manually
fix this on older databases, use:

> alter table datasource add column label text;

at the sqlite3 command.
